		Initial Models

			We started our project focusing on modularity, using lego as inspirations, everything was able to be snapped, from our tower height to the lights as well as the overall location of our towers. This had some benefits, but we realized that the benefits of modularity came at the expense of space efficiency and the additive of more steps into growing plants.

		Final Models

		<div class="subtext">
			Space efficiency is key! Everything needs to have a purpose on the moon. With our new design, we focused more on using all the space between parts, while not wasting any material that would need to be shipped up.
