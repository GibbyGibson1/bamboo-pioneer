			About Us and Our Project:
			<br>
			
			Growing Bamboo on the Moon would not be an easy task! We would need to overcome the lack of nutrients, manage humidity, temperature, as well as methane and other unwanted gasses. 

			<br>

			Our group is taking a Rapid Innovation Process to heart, by adding, designing, and testing new ideas every day. We regularly use 3D printers to allow us to rapidly change and innovate. We also have access to a CNC machine as well for more permanent solutions.

			Our group (from left to right): Omar Lara, Colin McKemie, Brandon Gibson
